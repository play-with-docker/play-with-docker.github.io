## Hands-on Learning
Give Docker a try with these three beginning tutorials:

* [Your First Linux Containers](/ops-s1-hello): In this lab you will explore the basics of running containers: pulling images from a registry, running an containerized application, and container instances and isolation.

* [Customizing Docker Images](/ops-s1-images): Move on to building your own custom Docker images and explore the Docker concept of image layers and the Dockerfile.

* [Deploy and Managing Multiple Containers](/ops-s1-swarm-intro): Real apps consist of multiple components. In this lab you will begin to explore running multiple services as a single stack with Docker Swarm.
