This lab is longer than the other ones. It is designed
to follow the part 1 ("from Compose to Swarm") but can
also be done independently (it provides jump-start
instructions if you want to skip part 1).

You will learn about the security features of Swarm:
secrets, cluster locking, network encryption, and more.

You will also see how to implement logging, metrics,
and will given a galore of tips and tricks to operate
Swarm.

We recommend that you open two tabs or two windows
for that lab: one for the materials, another for
the Play-With-Docker environment.
