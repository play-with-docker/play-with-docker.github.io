This self-paced learning journey is designed for IT Pros and System Administrators and will introduce you to Docker containers and the ways IT organizations like yours have started using Docker in their environment. We've designed three stages to guide you through this journey:

## [Stage 1: The Basics](/ops-stage1)

This stage will
  
  * Get you familiar with the core concepts of Docker

  * Help you understand the fundamental value proposition for Docker

  * Help you see how Docker can help your organization

<!-- I'd suggest hiding stages 2 & 3 for now...maybe we list them with no links as a preview of what's to come -->
## [Stage 2: Digging Deeper](/ops-stage2)

This stage will help you

  * Understand the architecture of Docker, and the core features

  * Understand how to integrate Docker into your existing application infrastructure

  * Develop a proof of concept application deployment

## [Stage 3: Moving to Production](/ops-stage3)

This final stage will help you

  * Prepare to implement a full proof of concept application

  * Develop a strategy for integrating Docker into your existing production 
  environment

  * Become recognized as a leader in your organization on implementing Docker

# Stage One
Welcome to the first stage of your Docker learning joureny. This stage will 
  
  * Get you familiar with the core concepts of Docker

  * Help you understand why other IT leaders are rapidly adopting Docker

  * Help you see how Docker can help your organization

For an introduction to Docker specifically geared towards for sys admins and IT Pros, check out Mike Coleman's talk <em>Docker?!? But I'm a SYSADMIN!</em>

## Hands-on Learning
Give Docker a try with these three beginning tutorials:

* [Your First Linux Containers](/ops-s1-hello): In this lab you will explore the basics of running containers: pulling images from a registry, running an containerized application, and container instances and isolation.

* [Customizing Docker Images](/ops-s1-images): Move on to building your own custom Docker images and explore the Docker concept of image layers and the Dockerfile.

* [Deploy and Managing Multiple Containers](/ops-s1-swarm-intro): Real apps consist of multiple components. In this lab you will begin to explore running multiple services as a single stack with Docker Swarm.

# Stage Two


This stage will help you

## Bonus materials
As a bonus, check out these videos. The first video is from DockerCon 2017 in Austin and features Nico Kabar discussing design considerations, tools and best practices to address a globally distributed bybrid cloud infrastructure with hundres or even thousands of apps using Docker.

And this next talk is from DockerCon EU 2017. In it, Diogo Monica discusses securing traditional applications using Docker, and showcase how modernizing these apps by moving them into containers not only makes make them portable and cost-efficient but also allows you to run legacy applications more securely, without having to make code changes.

# Stage 3

In this section, we concentrate on moving into Production with Docker.
