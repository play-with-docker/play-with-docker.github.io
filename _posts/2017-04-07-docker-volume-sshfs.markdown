## Docker volume plugins

Docker Engine volume plugins enable Engine deployments to be integrated with external storage systems such as Amazon EBS, and enable data volumes to persist beyond the lifetime of a single Docker host. See [the plugin documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/legacy_plugins/) for more information.




## Setting up

First we install openssh and configure test user with password `testpassword` in the second node

```.term2
apk add --no-cache openssh
adduser -D test
echo "test:testpassword" | chpasswd
ssh-keygen -N "" -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
/usr/sbin/sshd
```

You can safely ignore any `Could not load host key` error messages.

Now, let's install the plugin and create a docker volume with it

```.term1
mkdir /var/lib/docker/plugins # Shouldn't have to do this if graph folder is somewhere else
docker plugin install --grant-all-permissions vieux/sshfs
docker volume create -d vieux/sshfs -o sshcmd=test@node2:/home/test -o password=testpassword sshvolume
```

We can now use the plugin volume in a container as usual

```.term1
docker run -it -v sshvolume:/test alpine sh -c 'echo "Hello world" > /test/somefile'
```

Now we check that the file has been created in the second node

```.term2
cat /home/test/somefile
```
