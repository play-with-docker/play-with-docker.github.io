This final stage will help you

  * Implement a full proof of concept application

  * Develop a strategy for integrating Docker into your existing production 
  environment

  * Become recognized as a leader in your organization on implementing Docker

In this stage we have a series of design and reference architectures that help you understand the best ways to structure your apps with Docker. And a good video overview of the process at the end.
