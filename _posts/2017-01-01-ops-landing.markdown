This self-paced learning journey for IT Pros and System Administrators will help you understand and be able to deploy applications with Docker. We've designed three stages.

## [Stage 1: The Basics](#stage-one)

This stage will 
  
  * Get you familiar with the core concepts of Docker

  * Help you understand the fundamental value proposition for Docker

  * Help you see how Docker can help your organization


## [Stage 2: Digging Deeper](#stage-two)

This stage will help you

  * Understand the architecture of Docker, and the core features

  * Understand how to integrate Docker into your existing application infrastructure

  * Develop a proof of concept application deployment

## [Stage 3: Moving to Production](#stage-three)

This final stage will help you

  * Implement a full proof of concept application

  * Develop a strategy for integrating Docker into your existing production 
  environment

  * Become recognized as a leader in your organization on implementing Docker

This stage will 
  
  * Get you familiar with the core concepts of Docker

  * Help you understand the fundamental value proposition for Docker

  * Help you see how Docker can help your organization

# Stage One

For an introduction to Docker specifically for sys admins and IT Pros, check out Mike Coleman's talk <em>Docker?!? But I'm a SYSADMIN!</em>

## Hands-on Learning
Give Docker a try with these two beginning tutorials:

[Docker for Beginners - Linux](/beginner-linux)

[Deploy a multi-service application](/swarm-stack-intro)

## More Reading: Ebook
To understand the differences between containers and VMs, check out this ebook: [Docker for the Virtualization Admin](https://goto.docker.com/docker-for-the-virtualization-admin.html)


# Stage Two
This stage will help you

  * Understand the architecture of Docker, and the core features

  * Understand how to integrate Docker into your existing application infrastructure

  * Develop a proof of concept application deployment

## Bonus materials
As a bonus, check out these videos. The first video is from DockerCon 2017 in Austin and features Brandon Royal showing you how to port traditional monolithic applications to modern Docker based applications.

Next we have Nico Kabar discusses design considerations, tools and best practices to address a globally distributed bybrid cloud infrastructure with hundres or even thousands of apps using Docker.

# Stage Three
This final stage will help you

  * Implement a full proof of concept application

  * Develop a strategy for integrating Docker into your existing production 
  environment

  * Become recognized as a leader in your organization on implementing Docker

In this stage we have a series of design and reference architectures that help you understand the best ways to structure your apps with Docker. And a good video overview of the process at the end.
