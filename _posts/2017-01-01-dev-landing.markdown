This self-paced learning journey for Developers will help you understand and be able to deploy applications with Docker. We've designed three stages.

## [Stage 1: The Basics](#stage-one)

This stage will 
  
  * Get you familiar with the core concepts of Docker

  * Show you how to build and deploy basic applications


## [Stage 2: Digging Deeper](#stage-two)

This stage show you how to

  * Create and run Docker image registries

  * Use Docker with in a continuous integration environment
 

## [Stage 3: Moving to Staging](#stage-three)

This final stage will help you

  * Deploy an application to a staging environment

  * Manage your staging environment with Docker Swarm Mode

  * Learn how to build a secure application
