In this tutorial we will learn about basic application containerization using Docker and running various components of an application as microservices.
We will utilize [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for orchestration during the development.
This tutorial is targeted for beginners who have the basic familiarity with Docker.
If you are new to Docker, we recommend you check out [Docker for Beginners](/beginner-linux) tutorial first.

We will start from a basic Python script that scrapes links from a given web page and gradually evolve it into a multi-service application stack.
The demo code is available in the [Link Extractor](https://github.com/ibnesayeed/linkextractor) repo.
The code is organized in steps that incrementally introduce changes and new concepts.
After completion, the application stack will contain the following microservices:

* A web application written in PHP and served using Apache that takes a URL as the input and summarizes extracted links from it
* The web application talks to an API server written in Python (and Ruby) that takes care of the link extraction and returns a JSON response
* A Redis cache that is used by the API server to avoid repeated fetch and link extraction for pages that are already scraped

The API server will only load the page of the input link from the web if it is not in the cache.
The stack will eventually look like the figure below:

This tutorial was initially developed for a colloquium in the [Computer Science Department](https://odu.edu/compsci) of the [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/), Norfolk, Virginia. A [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_X0F2FgYm8), [presentation slides](https://www.slideshare.net/ibnesayeed/introducing-docker-application-containerization-service-orchestration), and a brief description of the talk can be found in [a blog post](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2017/12/2017-12-03-introducing-docker.html).


> **Steps:**
> * Table of contents
> {:toc}


## Stage Setup

Let's get started by first cloning the demo code repository, changing the working directory, and checking the `demo` branch out.

```.term1
git clone https://github.com/ibnesayeed/linkextractor.git
cd linkextractor
git checkout demo
```


## Step 0: Basic Link Extractor Script

Checkout the `step0` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step0
tree
```

```
.
├── README.md
└── linkextractor.py

0 directories, 2 files
```

The `linkextractor.py` file is the interesting one here, so let's look at its contents:

```.term1
cat linkextractor.py
```

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

res = requests.get(sys.argv[-1])
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, "html.parser")
for link in soup.find_all("a"):
    print(link.get("href"))
```

This is a simple Python script that imports three packages: `sys` from the standard library and two popular third-party packages `requests` and `bs4`.
User-supplied command line argument (which is expected to be a URL to an HTML page) is used to fetch the page using the `requests` package, then parsed using the `BeautifulSoup`.
The parsed object is then iterated over to find all the anchor elements (i.e., `<a>` tags) and print the value of their `href` attribute that contains the hyperlink.

However, this seemingly simple script might not be the easiest one to run on a machine that does not meet its requirements.
The `README.md` file suggests how to run it, so let's give it a try:

```.term1
./linkextractor.py http://example.com/
```

```
bash: ./linkextractor.py: Permission denied
```

When we tried to execute it as a script, we got the `Permission denied` error.
Let's check the current permissions on this file:

```.term1
ls -l linkextractor.py
```

```
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root           220 Sep 23 16:26 linkextractor.py
```

This current permission `-rw-r--r--` indicates that the script is not set to be executable.
We can either change it by running `chmod a+x linkextractor.py` or run it as a Python program instead of a self-executing script as illustrated below:

```.term1
python linkextractor.py
```

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "linkextractor.py", line 5, in <module>
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
ImportError: No module named bs4
```

Here we got the first `ImportError` message because we are missing the third-party package needed by the script.
We can install that Python package (and potentially other missing packages) using one of the many techniques to make it work, but it is too much work for such a simple script, which might not be obvious for those who are not familiar with Python's ecosystem.

Depending on which machine and operating system you are trying to run this script on, what software is already installed, and how much access you have, you might face some of these potential difficulties:

* Is the script executable?
* Is Python installed on the machine?
* Can you install software on the machine?
* Is `pip` installed?
* Are `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` Python libraries installed?

This is where application containerization tools like Docker come in handy.
In the next step we will try to containerize this script and make it easier to execute.


## Step 1: Containerized Link Extractor Script

Checkout the `step1` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step1
tree
```

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
└── linkextractor.py

0 directories, 3 files
```

We have added one new file (i.e., `Dockerfile`) in this step.
Let's look into its contents:

```.term1
cat Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
FROM       python
LABEL      maintainer="Sawood Alam <@ibnesayeed>"

RUN        pip install beautifulsoup4
RUN        pip install requests

WORKDIR    /app
COPY       linkextractor.py /app/
RUN        chmod a+x linkextractor.py

ENTRYPOINT ["./linkextractor.py"]
```

Using this `Dockerfile` we can prepare a Docker image for this script.
We start from the official `python` Docker image that contains Python's run-time environment as well as necessary tools to install Python packages and dependencies.
We then add some metadata as labels (this step is not essential, but is a good practice nonetheless).
Next two instructions run the `pip install` command to install the two third-party packages needed for the script to function properly.
We then create a working directory `/app`, copy the `linkextractor.py` file in it, and change its permissions to make it an executable script.
Finally, we set the script as the entrypoint for the image.

So far, we have just described how we want our Docker image to be like, but didn't really build one.
So let's do just that:

```.term1
docker image build -t linkextractor:step1 .
```

This command should yield an output as illustrated below:

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  171.5kB
Step 1/8 : FROM       python

... [OUTPUT REDACTED] ...

Successfully built 226196ada9ab
Successfully tagged linkextractor:step1
```

We have crated a Docker image named `linkextractor:step1` based on the `Dockerfile` illustrated above.
If the build was successful, we should be able to see it in the list of image:

```.term1
docker image ls
```

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
linkextractor       step1               e067c677be37        2 seconds ago       931MB
python              latest              a9d071760c82        2 weeks ago         923MB
```

This image should have all the necessary ingredients packaged in it to run the script anywhere on a machine that supports Docker.
Now, let's run a one-off container with this image and extract links from some live web pages:

```.term1
docker container run -it --rm linkextractor:step1 http://example.com/
```

This outputs a single link that is present in the simple [example.com](http://example.com/) web page:

```
http://www.iana.org/domains/example
```

Let's try it on a web page with more links in it:

```.term1
docker container run -it --rm linkextractor:step1 https://training.play-with-docker.com/
```

```

https://twitter.com/docker
https://www.github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker.github.io
```

This looks good, but we can improve the output.
For example, some links are relative, we can convert them into full URLs and also provide the anchor text they are linked to.
In the next step we will make these changes and some other improvements to the script.


## Step 2: Link Extractor Module with Full URI and Anchor Text

Checkout the `step2` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step2
tree
```

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
└── linkextractor.py

0 directories, 3 files
```

In this step the `linkextractor.py` script is updated with the following functional changes:

* Paths are normalized to full URLs
* Reporting both links and anchor texts
* Usable as a module in other scripts

Let's have a look at the updated script:

```.term1
cat linkextractor.py
```

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def extract_links(url):
    res = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, "html.parser")
    base = url
    # TODO: Update base if a <base> element is present with the href attribute
    links = []
    for link in soup.find_all("a"):
        links.append({
            "text": " ".join(link.text.split()) or "[IMG]",
            "href": urljoin(base, link.get("href"))
        })
    return links

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("\nUsage:\n\t{} <URL>\n".format(sys.argv[0]))
        sys.exit(1)
    for link in extract_links(sys.argv[-1]):
        print("[{}]({})".format(link["text"], link["href"]))
```

The link extraction logic is abstracted into a function `extract_links` that accepts a URL as a parameter and returns a list of objects containing anchor texts and normalized hyperlinks.
This functionality can now be imported into other scripts as a module (which we will utilize in the next step).

Now, let's build a new image and see these changes in effect:

```.term1
docker image build -t linkextractor:step2 .
```

We have used a new tag `linkextractor:step2` for this image so that we don't overwrite the image from the `step0` to illustrate that they can co-exist and containers can be run using either of these images.

```.term1
docker image ls
```

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
linkextractor       step2               be2939eada96        3 seconds ago        931MB
linkextractor       step1               673d045a822f        About a minute ago   931MB
python              latest              a9d071760c82        2 weeks ago          923MB
```

Running a one-off container using the `linkextractor:step2` image should now yield an improved output:

```.term1
docker container run -it --rm linkextractor:step2 https://training.play-with-docker.com/
```

Running a container using the previous image `linkextractor:step1` should still result in the old output:

```.term1
docker container run -it --rm linkextractor:step1 https://training.play-with-docker.com/
```

So far, we have learned how to containerize a script with its necessary dependencies to make it more portable.
We have also learned how to make changes in the application and build different variants of Docker images that can co-exist.
In the next step we will build a web service that will utilize this script and will make the service run inside a Docker container.


## Step 3: Link Extractor API Service

Checkout the `step3` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step3
tree
```

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── linkextractor.py
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt

0 directories, 5 files
```

The following changes have been made in this step:

* Added a server script `main.py` that utilizes the link extraction module written in the last step
* The `Dockerfile` is updated to refer to the `main.py` file isntead
* Server is accessible as a WEB API at `http://<hostname>[:<prt>]/api/<url>`
* Dependencies are moved to the `requirements.txt` file
* Needs port mapping to make the service accessible outside of the container (the `Flask` server used here listens on port `5000` by default)

Let's first look at the `Dockerfile` for changes:

```.term1
cat Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
FROM       python
LABEL      maintainer="Sawood Alam <@ibnesayeed>"

WORKDIR    /app
COPY       requirements.txt /app/
RUN        pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY       *.py /app/
RUN        chmod a+x *.py

CMD        ["./main.py"]
```

Since we have started using `requirements.txt` for dependencies, we no longer need to run `pip install` command for individual packages.
The `ENTRYPOINT` directive is replaced with the `CMD` and it is referring to the `main.py` script that has the server code it because we do not want to use this image for one-off commands now.

The `linkextractor.py` module remains unchanged in this step, so let's look into the newly added `main.py` file:

```.term1
cat main.py
```

```py
!/usr/bin/env python

from flask import Flask
from flask import request
from flask import jsonify
from linkextractor import extract_links

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Usage: http://<hostname>[:<prt>]/api/<url>"

@app.route("/api/<path:url>")
def api(url):
    qs = request.query_string.decode("utf-8")
    if qs != "":
        url += "?" + qs
    links = extract_links(url)
    return jsonify(links)

app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
```

Here, we are importing `extract_links` function from the `linkextractor` module and converting the returned list of objects into a JSON response.

It's time to build a new image with these changes in place:

```.term1
docker image build -t linkextractor:step3 .
```

Then run the container in detached mode (`-d` flag) so that the terminal is available for other commands while the container is still running.
Note that we are mapping the port `5000` of the container with the `5000` of the host (using `-p 5000:5000` argument) to make it accessible from the host.
We are also assigning a name (`--name=linkextractor`) to the container to make it easier to see logs and kill or remove the container.

```.term1
docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name=linkextractor linkextractor:step3
```

If things go well, we should be able to see the container being listed in `Up` condition:

```.term1
docker container ls
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND             CREATED             STATUSPORTS                    NAMES
d69c0150a754        linkextractor:step3   "./main.py"         9 seconds ago       Up 8 seconds0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   linkextractor
```

We can now make an HTTP request in the form `/api/<url>` to talk to this server and fetch the response containing extracted links:

```.term1
curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/http://example.com/
```

```json
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 78
Server: Werkzeug/0.14.1 Python/3.7.0
Date: Sun, 23 Sep 2018 20:52:56 GMT

[{"href":"http://www.iana.org/domains/example","text":"More information..."}]
```

Now, we have the API service running that accepts requests in the form `/api/<url>` and responds with a JSON containing hyperlinks and anchor texts of all the links present in the web page at give `<url>`.

Since the container is running in detached mode, so we can't see what's happening inside, but we can see logs using the name `linkextractor` we assigned to our container:

```.term1
docker container logs linkextractor
```

```
* Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
  WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
172.17.0.1 - - [23/Sep/2018 20:52:56] "GET /api/http://example.com/ HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

We can see the messages logged when the server came up, and an entry of the request log when we ran the `curl` command.
Now we can kill and remove this container:

```.term1
docker container rm -f linkextractor
```

In this step we have successfully ran an API service listening on port `5000`.
This is great, but APIs and JSON responses are for machines, so in the next step we will run a web service with a human-friendly web interface in addition to this API service.


## Step 4: Link Extractor API and Web Front End Services

Checkout the `step4` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step4
tree
```

```
.
├── README.md
├── api
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── linkextractor.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── docker-compose.yml
└── www
    └── index.php

2 directories, 7 files
```

In this step the following changes have been made since the last step:

* The link extractor JSON API service (written in Python) is moved in a separate `./api` folder that has the exact same code as in the previous step
* A web front-end application is written in PHP under `./www` folder that talks to the JSON API
* The PHP application is mounted inside the official `php:7-apache` Docker image for easier modification during the development
* The web application is made accessible at `http://<hostname>[:<prt>]/?url=<url-encoded-url>`
* An environment variable `API_ENDPOINT` is used inside the PHP application to configure it to talk to the JSON API server
* A `docker-compose.yml` file is written to build various components and glue them together

In this step we are planning to run two separate containers, one for the API and the other for the web interface.
The latter needs a way to talk to the API server.
For the two containers to be able to talk to each other, we can either map their their ports on the host machine and use that for request routing or we can place the containers in a single private network and access directly.
Docker has an excellent support of networking and provides helpful commands to deal with networks.
Additionally, in a Docker network containers identify themselves using their names as hostnames to avoid hunting for their IP addresses in the private network.
However, we are not going to do any of this manually, instead we will be using Docker Compose to automate many of these tasks.

So let's look at the `docker-compose.yml` file we have:

```.term1
cat docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  api:
    image: api:python
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  web:
    image: php:7-apache
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - API_ENDPOINT=http://api:5000/api/
    volumes:
      - ./www:/var/www/html
```

This is a simple YAML file that describes the two services `api` and `web`.
The `api` service will use the `api:python` image that is not built yet, but will be built on-demand using the `Dockerfile` from the `./api` directory.
This service will be exposed on the port `5000` of the host.

The second service named `web` will use official `php:7-apache` image directly from the DockerHub, that's why we do not have a `Dockerfile` for it.
The service will be exposed on the default HTTP port (i.e., `80`).
We will supply an environment variable named `API_ENDPOINT` with the value `http://api:5000/api/` to tell the PHP script where to connect to.
Notice that we are not using an IP address here, instead, `api:5000` is being used because we will have a dynamic hostname entry in the private network for the API service matching its service name.
Finally, we will bind mount the `./www` folder to make the `index.php` file available inside of the `web` service container at `/var/www/html`, which is the default web root for the Apache web server.

Now, let's have a look at the user-facing `www/index.php` file:

```.term1
cat www/index.php
```

This is a long file that mainly contains all the markup and styles of the page.
However, the important block of code is in the beginning of the file as illustrated below:

```php
$api_endpoint = $_ENV["API_ENDPOINT"] ?: "http://localhost:5000/api/";
$url = "";
if(isset($_GET["url"]) && $_GET["url"] != "") {
  $url = $_GET["url"];
  $json = @file_get_contents($api_endpoint . $url);
  if($json == false) {
    $err = "Something is wrong with the URL: " . $url;
  } else {
    $links = json_decode($json, true);
    $domains = [];
    foreach($links as $link) {
      array_push($domains, parse_url($link["href"], PHP_URL_HOST));
    }
    $domainct = @array_count_values($domains);
    arsort($domainct);
  }
}
```

The `$api_endpoint` variable is initialized with the value of the environment variable supplied from the `docker-compose.yml` file as `$_ENV["API_ENDPOINT"]` (otherwise falls back to a default value of `http://localhost:5000/api/`).
The request is made using `file_get_contents` function that uses the `$api_endpoint` variable and user supplied URL from `$_GET["url"]`.
Some analysis and transformations are performed on the received response that are later used in the markup to populate the page.

Let's bring these services up in detached mode using `docker-compose` utility:

```.term1
docker-compose up -d --build
```

```
Creating network "linkextractor_default" with the default driver
Pulling web (php:7-apache)...
7-apache: Pulling from library/php

... [OUTPUT REDACTED] ...

Status: Downloaded newer image for php:7-apache

Step 1/8 : FROM       python
latest: Pulling from library/python

... [OUTPUT REDACTED] ...

Successfully built 83bea7a0a0eb
Successfully tagged api:python
Creating linkextractor_web_1 ... done
Creating linkextractor_api_1 ... done
```

This output shows that Docker Compose automatically created a network named `linkextractor_default`, pulled `php:7-apache` image from DockerHub, built `api:python` image using our local `Dockerfile`, and finally, spun two containers `linkextractor_web_1` and `linkextractor_api_1` that correspond to the two services we have defined in the YAML file above.

Checking for the list of running containers confirms that the two services are indeed running:

```.term1
docker container ls
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS   PORTS                    NAMES

```

We should now be able to talk to the API service as before:

```.term1
curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/http://example.com/
```

To access the web interface [click to open the Link Extractor](/){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="80"}.
Then fill the form with `https://training.play-with-docker.com/` (or any HTML page URL of your choice) and submit to extract links from it.

We have just created an application with microservice architecture, isolating individual tasks in separate services as opposed to monolithic applications where everything is put together in a single unit.
Microservice applications are relatively easier to scale, maintains, and move around.
They also allow easy swapping of components with an equivalent service.
More on that later.

Now, let's modify the `www/index.php` file to replace all occurrences of `Link Extractor` with `Super Link Extractor`:

```.term1
sed -i 's/Link Extractor/Super Link Extractor/g' www/index.php
```

Reloading the web interface of the application (or [clicking here](/){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="80"}) should now reflect this change in the title, header, and footer.
This is happening because the `./www` folder is bind mounted inside of the container, so any changes made outside will reflect inside the container or the vice versa.
This approach is very helpful in development, but in the production environment we would prefer our Docker images to be self-contained.
Let's revert these changes now to clean the Git tracking:

```.term1
git reset --hard
```

Before we move on to the next step we need to shut these services down, but Docker Compose can help us take care of it very easily:

```.term1
docker-compose down
```

```
Stopping linkextractor_api_1 ... done
Stopping linkextractor_web_1 ... done
Removing linkextractor_api_1 ... done
Removing linkextractor_web_1 ... done
Removing network linkextractor_default
```

In the next step we will add one more service to our stack and will build a self-contained custom image for our web interface service.


## Step 5: Redis Service for Caching

Checkout the `step5` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step5
tree
```

```
.
├── README.md
├── api
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── linkextractor.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── docker-compose.yml
└── www
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── index.php

2 directories, 8 files
```

Some noticeable changes from the previous step are as following:

* Another `Dockerfile` is added in the `./www` folder for the PHP web application to build a self-contained image and avoid live file mounting
* A Redis container is added for caching using the official Redis Docker image
* The API service talks to the Redis service to avoid downloading and parsing pages that were already scraped before

Let's first inspect the newly added `Dockerfile` under the `./www` folder:

```.term1
cat www/Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
FROM       php:7-apache
LABEL      maintainer="Sawood Alam <@ibnesayeed>"

COPY       . /var/www/html/
```

This is a rather simple `Dockerfile` that uses the official `php:7-apache` image as the base and copies all the files from the `./www` folder into the `/var/www/html/` folder of the image.
This is exactly what was happening in the previous step, but that was bind mounted using a volume, while here we are making the code part of the self-contained image.

Next, we will look at the API server's `api/main.py` file where we are utilizing the Redis cache:

```.term1
cat api/main.py
```

The file has many lines, but the important bits are as illustrated below:

```py
redis = Redis(host="redis", port=6379)
# ...
    jsonlinks = redis.get(url)
    if not jsonlinks:
        links = extract_links(url)
        jsonlinks = json.dumps(links, indent=2)
        redis.set(url, jsonlinks)
```

A `redis` client instance is created using the hostname `redis` (same as the name of the service as we will see later) and the default redis port `6379`.
We are first trying to see if a cache is present in the Redis store for given URL, if not then we use the `extract_links` function as before and populate the cache for future attempts.

Now, let's look into the udpated `docker-compose.yml` file:

```.term1
cat docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  api:
    image: api:python
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  web:
    image: web:php
    build: ./www
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - API_ENDPOINT=http://api:5000/api/
  redis:
    image: redis
```

The `api` service configuration remains the same as before.
For the `web` service, we are using the custom `web:php` image that will be built using the newly added `Dockerfile` in the `./www` folder.
We are no longer mounting the `./www` folder using the `volumes` config.
Finally, a new service named `redis` is added that will use the official image from DockerHub and needs no specific configurations for now.
This service is accessible to the Python API using its service name, the same way the API service is accessible to the PHP front-end service.

Let's boot these services up:

```.term1
docker-compose up -d --build
```

```
... [OUTPUT REDACTED] ...

Creating linkextractor_web_1   ... done
Creating linkextractor_api_1   ... done
Creating linkextractor_redis_1 ... done
```

Now, that all three services are up, access the web interface by [clicking the Link Extractor](/){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="80"}.
There should be no visual difference from the previous step.
However, if you extract links from a page with a lot of links, the first time it should take longer, but the successive attempts to the same page should return the response fairly quickly.

Now that we are not mounting the `/www` folder inside the container, local changes should not reflect in the running service:

```.term1
sed -i 's/Link Extractor/Super Link Extractor/g' www/index.php
```

Verify this by reloading the web interface and then revert changes:

```.term1
git reset --hard
```

Now, shut these services down and get ready for the next step:

```.term1
docker-compose down
```

```
Stopping linkextractor_web_1   ... done
Stopping linkextractor_redis_1 ... done
Stopping linkextractor_api_1   ... done
Removing linkextractor_web_1   ... done
Removing linkextractor_redis_1 ... done
Removing linkextractor_api_1   ... done
Removing network linkextractor_default
```

We have successfully orchestrated three microservices to compose our Link Extractor application.
We now have an application stack that represents the architecture illustrated in the figure shown in the introduction of this tutorial.
In the next step we will explore how easy it is to swap components from an application with the microservice architecture.


## Step 6: Swap Python API Service with Ruby

Checkout the `step6` branch and list files in it.

```.term1
git checkout step6
tree
```

```
.
├── README.md
├── api
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── Gemfile
│   └── linkextractor.rb
├── docker-compose.yml
├── logs
└── www
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── index.php

3 directories, 7 files
```

Some significant changes from the previous step include:

* The API service written in Python is replaced with a similar Ruby implementation
* The `API_ENDPOINT` environment variable is updated to point to the new Ruby API service
* The link extraction cache event (HIT/MISS) is logged and is persisted using volumes

Notice that the `./api` folder does not contain any Python scripts, instead, it now has a Ruby file and a `Gemfile` to manage dependencies.

Let's have a quick walk through the changes files:

```.term1
cat api/linkextractor.rb
```

```rb
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "sinatra"
require "open-uri"
require "uri"
require "nokogiri"
require "json"
require "redis"

set :protection, :except=>:path_traversal

redis = Redis.new(host: "redis", port: 6379)

Dir.mkdir("logs") unless Dir.exist?("logs")
cache_log = File.new("logs/extraction.log", "a")

get "/" do
  "Usage: http://<hostname>[:<prt>]/api/<url>"
end

get "/api/*" do
  url = [params['splat'].first, request.query_string].reject(&:empty?).join("?")
  cache_status = "HIT"
  jsonlinks = redis.get(url)
  if jsonlinks.nil?
    cache_status = "MISS"
    jsonlinks = JSON.pretty_generate(extract_links(url))
    redis.set(url, jsonlinks)
  end

  cache_log.puts "#{Time.now.to_i}\t#{cache_status}\t#{url}"

  status 200
  headers "content-type" => "application/json"
  body jsonlinks
end

def extract_links(url)
  links = []
  doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url))
  doc.css("a").each do |link|
    text = link.text.strip.split.join(" ")
    begin
      links.push({
        text: text.empty? ? "[IMG]" : text,
        href: URI.join(url, link["href"])
      })
    rescue
    end
  end
  links
end
```

This Ruby file is almost equivalent to what we had in Python before, except, in addition to that it also logs the link extraction requests and corresponding cache events.
In a microservice architecture application, swapping components with an equivalent one easy as long as the expectations of consumers of the component are maintained.

```.term1
cat api/Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
FROM       ruby
LABEL      maintainer="Sawood Alam <@ibnesayeed>"

ENV        LANG C.UTF-8

WORKDIR    /app
COPY       Gemfile /app/
RUN        bundle install

COPY       linkextractor.rb /app/
RUN        chmod a+x linkextractor.rb

CMD        ["./linkextractor.rb", "-o", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Above `Dockerfile` is written for the Ruby script and it is pretty much self-explanatory.

```.term1
cat docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
ersion: '3'

services:
  api:
    image: api:ruby
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
  web:
    image: web:php
    build: ./www
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - API_ENDPOINT=http://api:4567/api/
  redis:
    image: redis
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file has a few minor changes in it.
The `api` service image is now named `api:ruby`, the port mapping is changed from `5000` to `4567` (which is the default port for Sinatra server), and the `API_ENDPOINT` environment variable in the `web` service is updated accordingly so that the PHP code can talk to it.

With these in place, let's boot our service stack:

```.term1
docker-compose up -d --build
```

```
... [OUTPUT REDACTED] ...

Successfully built 8377c67aab58
Successfully tagged api:ruby
Creating linkextractor_web_1   ... done
Creating linkextractor_api_1   ... done
Creating linkextractor_redis_1 ... done
```

We should now be able to access the API (using the updated port number).

```.term1
curl -i http://localhost:4567/api/http://example.com/
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 96
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Server: WEBrick/1.4.2 (Ruby/2.5.1/2018-03-29)
Date: Mon, 24 Sep 2018 01:41:35 GMT
Connection: Keep-Alive

[
  {
    "text": "More information...",
    "href": "http://www.iana.org/domains/example"
  }
]
```

Now, open the web interface by [clicking the Link Extractor](/){:data-term=".term1"}{:data-port="80"} and extract links of a few URLs.
Also, try to repeat these attempts for some URLs.
If everything is alright, the web application should behave as before without noticing any changes in the API service (which is completely replaced).

We can shut the stack down now:

```.term1
docker-compose down
```

Since we have persisted logs, they should still be available after the services are gone:

```.term1
cat logs/extraction.log
```

```
1537753295      MISS    http://example.com/
1537753600      HIT     http://example.com/
1537753635      MISS    https://training.play-with-docker.com/
```

This illustrates that the caching is functional as the second attempt to the `http://example.com/` resulted in a cache `HIT`.

In this step we explored the possibility of swapping components of an application with microservice architecture with their equivalents without impacting rest of the parts of the stack.
We have also explored data persistence using bind mount volumes that persists even after the containers writing to the volume are gone.

So far, we have used `docker-compose` utility to orchestrate the application stack, which is good for development environment, but for production environment we use `docker stack deploy` command to run the application in a [Docker Swarm Cluster](/swarm-stack-intro).
It is left for you as an assignment to deploy this application in a Docker Swarm Cluster.


## Conclusions

We started this tutorial with a simple Python script that scrapes links from a give web page URL.
We demonstrated various difficulties in running the script.
We then illustrated how easy to run and portable the script becomes onces it is containerized.
In the later steps we gradually evolved the script into a multi-service application stack.
In the process we explored various concepts of microservice architecture and how Docker tools can be helpful in orchestrating a multi-service stack.
Finally, we demonstrated the ease of microservice component swapping and data persistence.

The next step would be to learn how to deploy such service stacks in a [Docker Swarm Cluster](/swarm-stack-intro).

As an aside, here are some introductory Docker slides.
