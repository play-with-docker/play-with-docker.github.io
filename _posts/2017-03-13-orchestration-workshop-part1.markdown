This lab is longer than the other ones. It features a demo app
built around a microservices architecture, defined through
a Compose file.

You will run this app on a single node. Then, to scale
that app on a cluster, you will learn the concepts powering
SwarmKit, Docker's native orchestration system. Armed
with this new knowledge, you will setup your own
Swarm cluster across five nodes, and use it to deploy
the demo app.

We recommend that you open two tabs or two windows
for that lab: one for the materials, another for
the Play-With-Docker environment.
