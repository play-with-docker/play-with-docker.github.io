Service Discovery under Swarm Mode.

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to illustrate how Service Discovery works under Swarm Mode.

## The application

WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. 
It is a very simple containers application often used for demo purposes during meetup and conferences.


## Init your swarm

Let's create a Docker Swarm first. Open up the first instance and initiate Swarm mode cluster.

```.term1
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -i)
```

This node becomes a master node. The output displays a command to add a worker node to this swarm as shown below:

```
Swarm initialized: current node (xf323rkhg80qy2pywkjkxqusp) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-089phhmfamjor1o1qj8s0l4wdhyvegphg6vtt9p3s8c35upltk-eecvhhtz1f2vpjhvc70v6v
vzb \
    10.0.50.3:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructi
ons.
```   

The above token ID is unique for every swarm mode cluster and hence might differ for your setup.
From the output above, copy the join command (*watch out for newlines*).

Next, Open up the new instance and paste the below command. This should join the new node to the swarm mode cluster and this new node becomes a worker node. In my case, the command would look something like this:

```
 docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-089phhmfamjor1o1qj8s0l4wdhyvegphg6vtt9p3s8c35upltk-eecvhhtz1f2vpjhvc70v6v
vzb \
    10.0.50.3:2377
```
Output:

```
$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-089phhmfamjor1o1qj8s0l4wdhyvegphg6vtt9p3s8c35upltk-eecvhh
tz1f2vpjhvc70v6vvzb 10.0.50.3:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```


## Show members of swarm

Type the below command in the first terminal:

```.term1
docker node ls
```

The output shows you both the manager and worker node indicating 2-node cluster:

```
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
xf323rkhg80qy2pywkjkxqusp *  node1     Ready   Active        Leader
za75md1p0hpc2qswefj8uyktk    node2     Ready   Active
```


If you try to execute an administrative command in a non-leader node `worker`, you'll get an error. Try it here:

```.term2
docker node ls
```

## Create an overlay network

```.term1
docker network create -d overlay net1
```

The above command generates an ID:

```
4md6wyy0pdpdzku6dj2z7yxjf
```

### List out the newly created overlay network using the below command: 


```.term1
docker network ls
```
The output should show the newly added network called "net1" holding swarm scope .

```
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
c30f13d9c242        bridge              bridge              local
990fa0ad6ab6        docker_gwbridge     bridge              local
c60123ff7abf        host                host                local
v7sp7ev6xfoo        ingress             overlay             swarm
4md6wyy0pdpd        net1                overlay             swarm
333c7d045239        none                null
```


### Creating MYSQL service

```.term1
docker service create \
           --replicas 1 \
           --name wordpressdb \
           --network net1 \
           --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql123 \
           --env MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress \
          mysql:latest
```

The above command creates a service named "wordpressdb" which belongs to "net1" network which runs a single replica of the container. It displays service ID as an output as shown:

```
ip9a8zl9rke256q92itgrm8ov
```

Run the below command to list out the service:

```.term1
docker service ls 
```


The output should be like the following one (your ID will display different though).

```
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE
ip9a8zl9rke2        wordpressdb         replicated          1/1                 mysql:latest
```

Let's list the tasks of the wordpressdb service.

```.term1
docker service ps wordpressdb
```

You should get an output like the following one where the 1 task  of the service are listed.

```
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE
      CURRENT STATE                ERROR               PORTS
puoe9lvfkcia        wordpressdb.1       mysql:latest        node1               Running
      Running about a minute ago
```


## Creating WordPress service


```.term1
docker service create \
           --replicas 4 \
           --name wordpressapp \
           --network net1 \
           --env WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=wordpressdb \
           --env WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=mysql123 \
          wordpress:latest
```

The above command creates a service named "wordpressapp" which belongs to "net1" network which runs 4 copies of wordpressapp container.
As output, this command displays a service ID as:

```
m4hca6rliz8wer2aojayv01r5
```

Listing out the services:

```.term1
docker service ls
```

Output:

```
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE
ip9a8zl9rke2        wordpressdb         replicated          1/1                 mysql:latest
m4hca6rliz8w        wordpressapp        replicated          4/4                 wordpress:late
st
```

You can list the tasks of the wordpressapp service using the command:

```.term1
docker service ps wordpressapp
```

Output:

```
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE
      CURRENT STATE                ERROR               PORTS

```


### Service Discovery

Let us try to discover wordpressdb service from within one of wordpressapp container. Open up the manager node instance and run the below command:

Open up instance of worker node and verify what containers are running:

```.term2
docker ps
```

This should display number of tasks(containers) running on the worker node locally:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS
           PORTS               NAMES
52f16028e12c        wordpress:latest    "docker-entrypoint..."   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minu
tes        80/tcp              wordpressapp.1.zg7wpvs1rbkiy4zwo71yk031i
f3271e89d54e        wordpress:latest    "docker-entrypoint..."   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minu
tes        80/tcp              wordpressapp.3.scia4v5i1znj378gujluad2ku

```

As shown above, there are 2 instances of wordpressapp task(container) running on the worker node.

Now, Open up manager node and confirm what task are running:

```.term1
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS
           PORTS               NAMES
b68d99cad3da        wordpress:latest    "docker-entrypoint..."   5 minutes ago       Up 4 minu
tes        80/tcp              wordpressapp.2.8rybe5m4urikqsqje6hcpou9t
657cff3e37d5        wordpress:latest    "docker-entrypoint..."   5 minutes ago       Up 4 minu
tes        80/tcp              wordpressapp.4.4avyixggcb8neej1h395ognt2
e71c164c36b3        mysql:latest        "docker-entrypoint..."   10 minutes ago      Up 10 min
utes       3306/tcp            wordpressdb.1.puoe9lvfkciavkrzrkbrhrl6e
```


As we notice, there are 2 instances of wordpressapp task(container) running on the manager node(shown above) and 1 instance of wordpressdb. 

Let's pick up the wordpressdb task running on the manager node and try to reach out to wordpressapp running on the remote worker node. Because the container is missing the `ping` command we need to install it first:

```.term1
docker exec -it e71 bash -c "apt update && apt -y install iputils-ping"
```

Once installed, we can ping wordpressapp as shown below:

```.term1
docker exec -it e71 ping wordpressapp
```

This should work successfully and be able to ping the wordpressapp as service name.

```
PING wordpressapp (10.0.0.4): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.0.4: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.052 ms
^C--- wordpressapp ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.052/0.052/0.052/0.000 ms
```

Let us try to reach out to remote wordpressapp container from one of the wordpressdb instance running on the worker node by its hostname:

```.term1
docker exec -it e71 ping wordpressapp.3.scia4v5i1znj378gujluad2ku
```

Output:

```
PING wordpressapp.3.scia4v5i1znj378gujluad2ku (10.0.0.5): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.0.5: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=6.175 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.5: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.131 ms
^C--- wordpressapp.3.scia4v5i1znj378gujluad2ku ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.131/3.153/6.175/3.022 ms
```


Voila ! We are able to ping wordpressapp service from container(running wordpresdb task) using the service name.Also, we were successful in reaching out to remote wordpressapp container using its hostname from one of wordpressdb container running in maanager node.
